        Made for anyone seeking a G-rated social opportunity,
        for young children and adults alike, the opportunity to glee
        in making funny faces, seed&#8209spitting contests, and a horrendous mess.
        Made for spring and summer outdoor picnics and potlucks. Enjoy!
      </p>

        And if you can't stand the idea of just eating a watermelon raw,
        or you lack the social breadth that's required to handle
        a whole lot of watermelon in one sitting, poke through the following
        recipes for one that seems a bit more practical.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, however, let's learn a bit about what, where, and when before diving
        into the how. You may not even realize how made you are for this particular
        delicious gem until you consider time and space!

        <p> Three kinds: How to determine ripeness, how to prepare, and how to enjoy. </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4 class="bullet"> How to determine ripeness </h4>
             <p> There's absolutely no point in bringing home a watermelon that doesn't
               actually smell like a watermelon. Your taste buds only tell you what something
               tastes like because your nose says it first. Take the time to determine whether
               your nose can pick out a ripe one - don't worry about being stared at; I've been
               there. Just know that if you hone the "sniff-out" skill, people will be lining
               up to ask you exactly how you know which watermelons are ripe.
               If you're in a grocery store where they wax their melons or where there's something
               that's smelling way stronger just a few feet away than the melon in your hands,
               here's one other thing that you can try: Flick your finger agains the side of the
               melon, as if flicking off an annoying insect. (Experts call this method "thumping.")
               If what responds is a hollow sound, you can bet it's ripe and ready to be eaten.
             </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4 class="bullet"> How to clean and prepare </h4>
             <p> The most you need to worry about for a watermelon is washing the outer rind. Sound ludicrous?
               Who knows what's been bumping up against it since it went from seed to you! And you're probably
               not going to wash your hands between the moment you hold a piece of watermelon in your hands to
               the next when you rub your eyes or lick your fingers.
               Once washed, the only other preparation is in selecting a large enough knife to clear your whole watermelon.
               I'm not picky, though I expect you to have no leftovers once cut. First determine what you'll be using your
               melon for and whether you want to be able to store any remainders in the fridge for later. If this is going
               to be the case, cut from one end in circular slices. If plastic-wrapped in the fridge later, the majority
               of the still-encased melon will stay fresh even if the part right up against the plastic doesn't.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4 class="bullet"> How to enjoy (recipes) </h4>
             <ul>
               <li> <p class="recipe"> Recipe 1: As Is </p>
                 <p> There's nothing stopping you from enjoying the watermelon just as is. So
                   there's nothing more I need to say here other than sit back and enjoy
                   the crisp crunch and sweet and cool insides. </p>
